# Database Principles and Design: Final Project

This project was built using open-source software USBwebserver v8.6, because it meets the project requirements of making a PHP based website with a MySQL database.

It can be easily deployed offline and doesn't require any installation, good for quick demos.

Directory breakdown:

- The project itself is in the "usbwebserver/" folder.
- The "PHP Files" folder contains a copy of all the PHP and HTML code I made. These are also found in the "usbwebserver/root/" folder
- "snickr_database.sql" file contains the MySQL code for the database which was exported from phpmyadmin.

Please read the pdf reports for details on my design explanations for the database and website, and screenshots of what the website looks like when ran.

- part 1 explains the database schema design, which was planned before making the application.
- part 2 explains the website design, how to navigate around it, and the various features.
